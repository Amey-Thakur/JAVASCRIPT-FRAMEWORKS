<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**JavaScript Frameworks Todo Apps** is a multicentric interactive ecosystem engineered to benchmark productivity patterns across the modern web landscape. By implementing the same functional requirements across 10 different technology stacks, this repository provides a definitive study into component architecture, state management, and cross-framework interoperability.

The project features a unique **Magic Sync** system: a Virtual Storage Bridge that patches the browser's storage engine to ensure seamless data persistence across all 10 framework implementations, from individual apps to the centralized portal.

### Framework Heuristics
The ecosystem is governed by strict **computational design patterns** ensuring fidelity and comparative accuracy:
*   **Virtual Storage Bridge**: Utilizes a custom-engineered `shell.js` interceptor that normalizes state persistence across disparate framework data schemas.
*   **Architectural Diversity**: Spans the entire spectrum of modern front-end engineering, from rugged minimal reactivity to full-scale enterprise platforms.
*   **Universal Persistence**: LocalStorage integration ensures the master task list remains synchronized across session restarts, regardless of the active framework.

> [!TIP]
> **Cross-Framework Synchronization Integration**
>
> To maximize benchmarking accuracy, the system employs a **Unified Persistence Layer**. **Virtual storage proxies** intercept framework-specific storage calls, and **data normalizers** transform entries into a shared archival format, strictly coupling all 10 applications with a single master state. This ensures the user's progress is preserved as they transition between different framework implementations.

<!-- QUICK START -->
<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20.x or 22.x**: Required for all framework build pipelines. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm 10+**: Standard package manager for dependency synchronization.
- **Git**: For version control and repository cloning. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> [!WARNING]
> **Storage Interoperability**
>
> The ecosystem utilizes a unified **Virtual Storage Bridge**. If running in "Incognito" or "Private" mode, the cross-framework **"Magic Sync"** may be restricted, preventing the master task list from persisting across framework transitions.

### 2. Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/JAVASCRIPT-FRAMEWORKS-TODO-APPS.git
cd JAVASCRIPT-FRAMEWORKS-TODO-APPS
```

#### Step 2: Framework Selection
Navigate to any of the 10 framework implementations within the **Source Code** directory:
```bash
cd "Source Code/[Framework App Name]"
```

#### Step 3: Install Core Dependencies
Synchronize the local environment with the mission requirements:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Execution Protocols
Launch the active development server according to the framework's protocol:

**Tier A (High-Performance)**: `React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit, Mithril, Alpine, Vanilla`
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Tier B (Enterprise/Compiler)**: `Angular, Stencil`
```bash
npm run start
```

### 4. Interactive Portal (Central Hub)
To browse the entire ecosystem through the unified **"Magic Sync" Portal**:

1.  Ensure you have built the apps or are running them as directed above.
2.  Navigate to the **Homepage** directory:
    ```bash
    cd "Source Code/Homepage"
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser (utilizing a local server like **Live Server** for full functionality).
